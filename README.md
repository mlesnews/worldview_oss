# WorldView OSS

An open-source real-time global intelligence dashboard built with Next.js 16, CesiumJS, and Tailwind CSS v4. View live flight traffic, satellite positions, earthquakes, asteroid trajectories, weather radar, and CCTV camera feeds — all rendered on a 3D globe through a military-grade "spy telescope" interface.

## Why This Exists

The original [WorldView](https://worldview.earth) project by [Bilawal Sidhu](https://x.com/nicebilal) is a stunning piece of work. But it's closed source. For a project built on top of open-source software — CesiumJS, Next.js, React, OpenSky Network, USGS feeds, CelesTrak, and countless other freely available APIs and libraries — keeping it proprietary is, frankly, a disservice to the community that made it possible in the first place.

Open source isn't just a license. It's a commitment to the ecosystem you benefit from. If your entire stack is open and the data you consume is public, your visualization layer shouldn't be locked behind a paywall or a waitlist.

**WorldView OSS is the answer.** Same concept, built from scratch, fully open. Fork it, extend it, learn from it, deploy it. That's the point.

## Features

- **3D Globe** — CesiumJS-powered interactive Earth with dark imagery tiles
- **Spy Telescope Layout** — Circular globe viewport with crosshairs, compass markers, and range rings
- **Live Data Layers**
  - ISS Flight Tracking (OpenSky Network)
  - Satellite Positions (CelesTrak TLE data)
  - Earthquakes (USGS real-time feed)
  - Near-Earth Asteroids (NASA NeoWs API)
  - Weather Radar (OpenWeatherMap)
  - CCTV Camera Feeds (Austin Mobility public network)
- **View Modes** — Electro-Optical, FLIR Thermal, CRT, Night Vision
- **Live CCTV Feeds** — Real traffic camera streams with simulated object detection overlay
- **Search** — Geocode any location and fly to it on the globe
- **Quick Nav** — One-click navigation to major world cities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Cesium Ion](https://ion.cesium.com/) access token (free tier works)
- Optional: [NASA API key](https://api.nasa.gov/), [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jedijamez567/worldview_oss.git
cd worldview_oss
npm install
```

### Configure

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_TOKEN=your_cesium_ion_token
NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key        # optional, falls back to DEMO_KEY
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key  # optional
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```
